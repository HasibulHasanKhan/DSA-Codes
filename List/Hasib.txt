List is similar to a vector . it store element of the same type and dynamically grow in size.

The major differenc between lists and vectors are : 

1. we can add and remove elements form both the beginning and at the end of a list , while vectors are generally optimized for adding and removing at the end.

2. Unlike vector, list does not support random access, mean we cannot directly jump to a specific index, or access elements by index numbers.
