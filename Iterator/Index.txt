/**
++i : Increment the value of i first , then returns the updated value.
i++ : Return thr original value of i first, then Increment i.

----------------------------------------------
For-Each Loop vs. Iterators : 

1. When we are just reading the element , and don't need to modify them, the for-each loop is much simplier and cleaner than iterations.

2. However, when we need to add, modify , or remove elements during iteration, iterate in reverse , or skip elements , we should use iterations.

-----------------------------------------
Focus on string& : 
What is string& in for (const string& car : cars)?
const: Ensures that the element cannot be modified in the loop.
string&: Declares a reference to each element of the vector.
Instead of creating a copy of each string in the vector during the loop, the loop accesses each string directly using a reference. This is efficient because copying strings can be expensive, ||especially for large strings.||
